# amaker


_NOTE: This is a WIP...for now this repo is focused only on getting the project to MVP.  It's not really setup for contributors just yet...working on it.  I'll get more docs out here soon.  Until then contact Mike Sandman directly if you have questions._

Amaker is a prototype for an assessment tool.

## Getting started

This app is built using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) [Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) [CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).  Follow those links to get setup with those tools.  You'll also want to checkout these items

- [Vuetify]() used for the UI.
- more coming here soon, stay tuned...

### Project setup

Clone this repo, then...
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Environments

AWS infrastructure, environments and CI/CD are handled by Amplify.  Easiest way to start is the [console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-2#/d2xhi708wd01a0).  You'll need an IAM account to access, again ask Mike until things get setup better.

App DNS is via [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/m/registrar/clustergarage.io).  Only ClusterGarage admins have access to this.

### Contributing

This project accepts contribution through [pull requests] only.

          - name: Right Sizing
            description: >-
                Right sizing is the process of matching resource types and sizes to your workload performance and
                capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost.  It’s also the process of looking at deployed
                instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other
                requirements, which results in lower costs.  Right sizing is the most effective way to control cloud
                costs. It involves continually analyzing instance performance and usage needs and patterns—and then
                turning off idle instances and right sizing instances that are either over-provisioned or poorly
                matched to the workload. Because your resource needs are always changing, right sizing must become an
                ongoing process to continually achieve cost optimization. You can make right sizing a smooth process by
                establishing a right-sizing schedule for each team, enforcing tagging for all instances, and taking
                full advantage of the powerful tools from providers and third-parties to simplify resource monitoring
                and analysis.
            goal: >-
                Reduce costs by lowering resource consumption without compromising reliability, performance, or other
                requirements

                          Using the system design requirements (e.g. performance, reliability, security, capacities,
                          RTO/RPO, SLA information) cost model each workload.  Consult provider resource specification
                          and recommended practices to ensure design requirements can be met.  Choose resource types
                          and sizes needed to might requirements.  Using this information in the provider cost
                          calculator, determine monthly run rate for each resource to arrive at complete workload cost.

            description: >-
                Perform pricing model analysis to allow an organization to choose different pricing model. Implement regions based on cost. Implement pricing models for all components of this workload
            samples:
                -  Life-cycle, usage, and SLA metrics are available for each workload
                -  Price modeling is performed on each workload
                -  Analysis is done for each workload based on metrics to determine break-even points
                -  Analysis is done to determine fitness for different models
                -  Capacity is planned below 80% of recommended break-point
                -  Workloads are automated to move to different regions
                -  Workloads are deployed to regions with the lowest cost
                -  Each component of a workload has been cost modeled
          - name: Optimize Data Transfer
            description: >-
                Perform data transfer modeling. Select components to optimize data transfer cost. Implement services to reduce data transfer costs
            samples:
                -  There is well-defined data transfer metrics for each workload
                -  Data transfer metrics are from real-world usage or realistic modeling i.e., not a SWAG
                -  Usage variation, spikes, and seasonality have been modeled
                -  Workloads are designed to reduce data transfer costs
                -  WAN optimization, multi-AZ, and multi-region have been factored into the design
                -  Services are implemented to reduce cost i.e. CDN's, direct connects, caching
                -  There is a well-known plan to review data transfer and services
